description: Learn how to use the shutdown command in CMD for Windows, including syntax, options, and examples.
---

The `shutdown` command in CMD is a powerful Windows tool used to turn off or restart a local or remote computer. It can also be used to log off the current user or end a session on a Remote Desktop server. This command is particularly useful for system administrators who need to manage multiple computers or schedule shutdowns and restarts. The `shutdown` command offers various switches to specify the action to be performed, such as shutting down, restarting, or logging off. Additionally, it allows setting a timer for the action to occur after a specified period or at a particular time. It's important to use this command with caution, as unsaved data may be lost when a computer is shut down or restarted.
