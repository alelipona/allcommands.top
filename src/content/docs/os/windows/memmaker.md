title: What is MEMMAKER Windows command?
description: Optimize your system's memory management with the Windows memmaker command.
---

The Windows memmaker command is a tool designed to optimize memory management on older Windows systems. It helps create more efficient use of conventional memory by rearranging drivers and programs in high memory. By doing this, memmaker can improve system performance and prevent common memory issues like out of memory errors.

## MEMMAKER Syntax:
```cmd
memmaker [/D | /D+ | /D-] [/V] [/E | /E+ | /E-] [/P | /P+] [/F | /F+] [/R] [/S | drive:path] [/T | drive:path] [/C] [/L:file] [/Q | /Q+ | /Q-]
```

## MEMMAKER Options:
| Option      | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| /D          | Displays the amount of memory that MEMMAKER can free up. |
| /D+         | Enables the reporting of loadhigh statistics.      |
| /D-         | Disables the reporting of loadhigh statistics.     |
| /V          | Verifies expanded memory usabillity.               |
| /E          | Specifies the degrees of optimization (speed vs. memory usage). |
| /E+         | Maximizes memory optimization for speed.           |
| /E-         | Minimizes memory optimization for compatibility.   |
| /P          | Indicates that you have a 386 processor.           |
| /P+         | Treats the processor as an 80386 or greater.       |
| /F          | Prevents the use of extended memory by simple EMS requests. |
| /F+         | Forces the use of more efficient EEMS techniques.  |
| /R          | Reboots the computer when MEMMAKER is complete.    |
| /S          | Specifies an alternate source drive or directory for MEMMAKER. |
| /T          | Specifies an alternate target drive or directory for MEMMAKER. |
| /C          | Continues the installation on confirmation.        |
| /L:file     | Logs the results to the specified file.            |
| /Q          | Specifies a quiet mode for automated processing.  |
| /Q+         | Suppresses prompts for user confirmation.          |
| /Q-         | Enables prompts for user confirmation.             |

## Parameters:
| Parameter    | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| drive:path   | Specifies the drive and directory to optimize.    |

### How do I use memmaker in Windows?
To use the memmaker command in CMD, execute the following command:
```cmd
memmaker --optimize
```

### What is the purpose of memmaker in Windows?
The memmaker command in Windows is used to optimize memory usage by making adjustments to memory allocation.

### How can memmaker help improve system performance?
By optimizing memory allocation, memmaker can help reduce memory conflicts and improve overall system performance.

### Is it safe to use memmaker on my Windows system?
Yes, it is safe to use memmaker on your Windows system as it is a built-in command designed to help optimize memory usage.

### Can I undo the changes made by memmaker?
Yes, you can undo the changes made by memmaker by running the command with appropriate options or reverting to a previous system restore point.

### How do I check the current memory status after using memmaker?
To check the current memory status after using memmaker, you can use the following command:
```cmd
memmaker --status
```

### Are there any risks associated with using memmaker?
While memmaker is generally safe to use, it is recommended to create a backup of important data before making any memory optimizations to avoid any potential risks.

### What is the difference between memmaker and other memory management tools?
Memmaker is a command-line tool specific to Windows that focuses on optimizing memory usage within the system, whereas other memory management tools may offer additional features and functionalities beyond memory optimization.
