The Windows loadfix command is used to load a program above the first 64K of conventional memory. This command is particularly useful for older DOS programs that have memory limitations. By using loadfix, you can ensure that the program runs smoothly without being constrained by low memory issues.

## LOADFIX Syntax:
```cmd
LOADFIX [drive:][path]filename
```
## Options:
| Option         | Description                                     |
