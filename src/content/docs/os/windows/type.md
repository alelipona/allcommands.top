The Windows TYPE command is a built-in utility that allows users to display the contents of a text file directly in the command prompt. This can be useful for quickly viewing the contents of a file without having to open it in a separate application. By simply typing "type" followed by the path to the text file, users can easily read the contents of the file within the command prompt window. This can be particularly handy when working with text files or when troubleshooting issues that may be related to the file's contents.
## TYPE Syntax:
```cmd
ping [options] destination
```

## TYPE Usage:
### Display the contents of a text file
```cmd
type filename.txt
```
This command will display the contents of the specified text file on the console.

### Display the contents of multiple text files
```cmd
type file1.txt file2.txt
```
Using this command, you can display the contents of multiple text files in the order specified.

### Combine and display contents of two text files
```cmd
type file1.txt >> combinedfiles.txt
type file2.txt >> combinedfiles.txt

```
The above commands first concatenate the contents of two text files into a new file named 'combinedfiles.txt' and then display the combined contents.

### View the contents of a text file with line numbers
```cmd
type filename.txt | find /v /n ""
```
This command will display the contents of the specified text file along with line numbers on the console.
:::tip
When using the type command in Windows, make sure to specify the correct file path along with the filename and extension to display the contents of the file accurately. Additionally, you can use redirection to save the output of the type command to a new file by using the ">" symbol followed by the filename.
