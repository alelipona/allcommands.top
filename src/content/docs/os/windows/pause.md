description: Learn how to use the Windows pause command to pause the execution of a batch file and display a "Press any key to continue..." message.
---

The Windows pause command is used in batch files to temporarily pause the execution of the script and display a message prompting the user to press any key to continue. This command is often used to prevent the command prompt window from closing immediately after the script has finished running, giving users the opportunity to review any output or messages displayed during the script's execution. The pause command is a simple and effective way to ensure that important information is not missed before the window closes.
