## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                                    |

|          1 | Represents the first parameter in the list.    |
## SHIFT Command Usage Examples:
### Shift the Command Line Arguments
```cmd
@echo off
shift
echo %1
```
This script shifts the command line arguments by one position and then echoes the first argument.

### Iterate Through Command Line Arguments
```cmd
@echo off
:loop
if "%1"=="" goto end
echo %1
shift
goto loop
:end
```
This script loops through and echoes all the command line arguments one by one by shifting them in each iteration.

### Process Command Line Arguments
```cmd
@echo off
:process
if "%1"=="" goto end
echo Processing %1...
shift
goto process
:end
```
This script processes each command line argument in a loop by shifting through them.

### Dynamically Handle Arguments
```cmd
@echo off
:process
set param=%1
if "%param%"=="" goto end
echo Processing %param%...
shift
goto process
:end
```
This script dynamically handles command line arguments by storing them in a variable before shifting to the next argument.

### Execute a series of commands with shifted arguments
```cmd
@echo off
shift /3
echo Third argument: %1
```
This script executes a series of commands after shifting the arguments by 3 positions, echoing the third shifted argument.
:::tip
When using the shift command in Windows CMD, remember that it is mainly used to shift the command-line parameters one position to the left. This can be useful when processing multiple command-line arguments in a script or batch file.
