title: DEBUG Windows Command Guide
description: A comprehensive guide to the Windows debug command, including its syntax, parameters, and how to use it for troubleshooting and analyzing programs.
---

The Windows debug command is a powerful tool used for troubleshooting and analyzing programs at the machine code level. It allows users to interact directly with the operating system and make low-level changes to programs. The debug command can be used to view and modify memory contents, disassemble machine code instructions, set breakpoints, and control program execution. 

To start the debug command, simply open a command prompt and type "debug" followed by the name of the program you want to analyze. From there, you can use various commands and shortcuts to navigate through the program's code, inspect registers and memory locations, and modify the program's behavior.

Some common commands used in the debug command include "n" to execute the next instruction, "u" to disassemble code, and "g" to continue execution until a breakpoint is reached. Additionally, the debug command supports various parameters and options to customize its behavior, such as specifying a source file or setting breakpoints at specific memory addresses.

Overall, the Windows debug command is a valuable tool for advanced users and developers who need to troubleshoot complex programs or analyze system behavior at a low level. By understanding how to use the debug command effectively, users can gain valuable insights into program execution and identify and fix issues that may not be visible at higher levels of abstraction.
## DEBUG Syntax:
```cmd
debug [drive:][path\]filename [parameters]
```
## Options:
| Option   | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| -b       | Sets a breakpoint at the specified address. |
| -g       | Begins execution at the current address.   |
| -t       | Single steps through the program.         |
| -u       | Unassembles the specified range of memory. |

## Parameters:
| Parameter  | Description                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| drive:path | Specifies the location and name of the file to be debugged. |
## DEBUG Command Samples:
### Run DEBUG
```cmd
debug
```
Launches the DEBUG command-line tool for low-level debugging.

### Load a Program for Debugging
```cmd
debug program.com
```
Loads the specified program file "program.com" into the DEBUG environment for debugging.

### Display Current Register Values
```cmd
-r
```
Shows the current values of all registers in the DEBUG environment.

### Assemble Machine Code
```cmd
-a 100
```
Switches to assembly mode and sets the next instruction to be assembled at memory location 100.

### Set a Breakpoint
```cmd
-t
```
Sets a software breakpoint at the next instruction to be executed in the DEBUG environment.

### Display Memory Contents
```cmd
-ds:100
```
Displays the memory contents starting at the segment address 100 using word length as the default.

### Execute the Next Instruction
```cmd
g
```
Executes the next instruction in the program loaded into the DEBUG environment.
