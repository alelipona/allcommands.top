description: Learn about the EMM386 command for Windows and how it can enhance your system's memory management.
---

EMM386 is a Windows command that allows access to the computer's extended memory, providing more memory for applications and optimizing system performance. It is commonly used in older versions of Windows to enable access to memory above the 1 MB limit. By loading EMM386, users can take advantage of Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) and Extended Memory Specification (XMS) to enhance the efficiency of their systems. EMM386 can be configured with various options to customize its behavior and allocation of memory resources, making it a useful tool for managing system memory on compatible Windows operating systems.
## EMM386 Syntax:
```cmd
emm386 [option] [parameter]
```

## Options:
| Option | Description                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| RAM    | Specifies the amount of memory to use   |
| I=B    | Specifies the input/output port address |
| X=B    | Specifies the ROM address               |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| NOEMS     | Disables EMS memory                   |
| NOVCPI    | Disables VCPI memory                  |
| FRAME=xxx | Sets the frame address for EMS memory |

:::caution
Make sure to double-check the values you provide for the options and parameters in the EMM386 command. Incorrect values can cause system instability or errors.

### Exclude a Memory Range
```cmd
emm386 excludememory 640-1024
```
Excludes the memory range from 640 KB to 1024 KB from EMS allocation.
:::tip
