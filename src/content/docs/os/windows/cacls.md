---

The cacls (Change Access Control Lists) command in Windows allows users to manage file permissions and security settings for files and directories. By using cacls, users can display the current ACLs (Access Control Lists) for a specific file or directory, as well as modify or replace them as needed. This command is useful for system administrators and IT professionals who need to set specific permissions for different users or groups on a Windows system. With cacls, users can grant or revoke permissions such as read, write, and execute for individual users or groups, providing a higher level of security and control over files and directories.

cacls [FileName] [/T] [/E] [/C] [/G User:Permission] [/R User] [/P User:Permission] [/D User]
