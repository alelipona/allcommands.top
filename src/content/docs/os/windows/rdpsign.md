The Windows rdpsign command is used to digitally sign Remote Desktop Protocol (.rdp) files, ensuring secure connections between devices.

## RDPSIGN Syntax:
```cmd
rdpsign /sha1 {SHA1 thumbprint} /n {file name} [/s {storename}] [/v] [/q]
```

## RDPSIGN Options:
| Option          | Description                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| /sha1           | Specifies the SHA1 thumbprint of the signing cert.   |
| /n              | Specifies the file to sign.                          |
| /s              | Specifies the certificate store containing the cert. |
| /v              | Enables verbose mode.                                |
| /q              | Quiet mode, suppresses all output.                   |

|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| {SHA1 thumbprint} | The SHA1 thumbprint of the signing certificate. |
| {file name}      | The file to be signed.                           |
| {storename}      | The certificate store where the cert is located. |
## RDPSIGN Command Usage Examples:
### Sign an RDP file
```cmd
rdpsign sign /sha256 /as /v path\to\rdpfile.rdp
```
This command signs an RDP file using a SHA256 hash algorithm with an autogenerated key and displays verbose output.

### Verify an RDP file signature
```cmd
rdpsign verify /v path\to\signedfile.rdp
```
Verify the signature of the signed RDP file and display verbose output.

### Remove a signature from an RDP file
```cmd
rdpsign remove /v path\to\signedfile.rdp
```
Removes the signature from the specified RDP file and displays verbose output.

### Sign an RDP file using a specific certificate
```cmd
rdpsign sign /as /sha256 /v /v cert thumbprint path\to\rdpfile.rdp
```
Signs an RDP file with a specified certificate (by its thumbprint) using the SHA256 hash algorithm and displays verbose output.

### List all certificates in the certificate store
```cmd
rdpsign listcerts
```
Displays a list of all certificates stored in the certificate store that can be used for signing RDP files.
:::tip
When using the rdpsign command in Windows, make sure to carefully review the available options and their corresponding values to ensure the correct signing of RDP files.
