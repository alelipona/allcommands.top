title: All About RPCPING Windows command
description: Check connectivity with the Windows rpcping command, troubleshoot RPC errors & test RPC communication.
---

The Windows rpcping command is a powerful tool for troubleshooting RPC communication issues. It allows users to test connectivity, verify RPC endpoint connectivity, and diagnose various RPC errors. By using rpcping, users can easily identify and resolve connectivity problems, ensuring smooth communication between different network components. The command provides detailed information about the RPC connection, helping users pinpoint the source of any communication issues quickly and efficiently.

## RPCPING Syntax:
```cmd
rpcping [options] [parameters]
```

## Options:
| Option | Description                           |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| -t     | Specifies the number of retries       |
| -o     | Specifies a timeout value in seconds   |
| -u     | Uses UDP instead of TCP               |
| -e     | Enables extended reporting            |
| -s     | Shows status of RPC service on server |
| -l     | Specifies the log file path           |

## Parameters:
| Parameter       | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| target          | Specifies the target server for RPC testing      |
| port            | Specifies the port number for RPC testing        |
| protocol        | Specifies the protocol to use (ncacn_np, etc.)   |
| endpoint        | Specifies the endpoint to bind to                |
| service         | Specifies the service to use (e.g., svcctl)      |
| authlevel       | Specifies the authentication level to use        |
| authntication   | Specifies the authentication service to use       |
| secqos          | Specifies the security quality of service        |
| serverspn       | Specifies the SPN to authenticate with           |
| securechannel   | Specifies whether to use secure channel for RPC  |
| commonendpoint  | Specifies a common endpoint for all interfaces   |

:::caution
It is recommended to exercise caution when using the rpcping command as it can directly impact the RPC services on the target server. Make sure to carefully review the options and parameters before running the command to avoid unintentional disruptions.

## RPCPING CMD Examples:

### Query RPC Endpoint on a Remote Server
```cmd
rpcping -s <RemoteServerName> -e 135
```
Queries the RPC endpoint on a remote server using port 135.

### Test Connectivity to a Specific Port
```cmd
rpcping -t ncacn_ip_tcp -s <IPaddress> -o 0 -t ncacn_ip_tcp -q "<UUID>" -a privacy -ep <EndPointName>
```
Tests connectivity to a specific port on a remote server using the specified endpoint.

### Check RPC Active Directory Response
```cmd
rpcping -s <DomainControllerName> -o 1 -MSA
```
Checks the RPC active directory response on a domain controller.

### Test RPC Connectivity over TCP/IP
```cmd
rpcping -s <ServerName> -o 1 -n 1 -a 9 -u 10 -v 3
```
Tests RPC connectivity over TCP/IP with the specified settings.

### Verify Active Directory Replication over RPC
```cmd
rpcping -s <DCName1> -o 32 -t ncacn_ip_tcp -q "<UUID>" -a integrity -ep <EndpointName>
```
Verifies Active Directory replication over RPC using specified parameters.

### Check RPC Connectivity Using Specific Authentication
```cmd
rpcping -s <ServerName> -o 1 -MSA -e 1 -a integrity
```
Checks RPC connectivity on a server using specific authentication mechanisms.
:::tip
When using the rpcping command in Windows, make sure to carefully review the available options and parameters to ensure the command is executed correctly.

### How do I use rpcping in Windows?
To use the rpcping command in Windows, execute the following command:
```cmd
rpcping /t ncacn_http -s localhost -o 1 -I 0 -H 1 -t ncacn_http -o RpcHttpConnectionA_Info
```

### What is the purpose of rpcping command in Windows?
The rpcping command is used to check the RPC connectivity to a specified server.

### How can I specify the server to test RPC connectivity using rpcping?
You can specify the server to test RPC connectivity with the -s option followed by the server name or IP address. For example:
```cmd
rpcping /s example_server
```

### How do I specify the protocol to use with rpcping command?
To specify the protocol to use with rpcping, you can use the -t option followed by the protocol type. For instance:
```cmd
rpcping /t ncacn_ip_tcp
```

### How can I set a specific option value with the rpcping command?
You can set a specific option value using the -o option followed by the desired value. For example:
```cmd
rpcping -s localhost -o 1
```

### How do I troubleshoot RPC connectivity using rpcping in Windows?
To troubleshoot RPC connectivity using rpcping, you can include options like -I (ping interval) and -H (ping count) in the command. Example:
```cmd
rpcping -s example_server -I 5 -H 10
```

### Can I test RPC connectivity over a specific port with rpcping?
Yes, you can test RPC connectivity over a specific port by specifying the port number using the -80 option. For instance:
```cmd
rpcping -s server.example.com:135
```

### How do I get detailed information about the RPC connection using rpcping?
You can get detailed information about the RPC connection by including the -o option followed by the RpcHttpConnectionA_Info value in the rpcping command. Example:
```cmd
