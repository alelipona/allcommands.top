The Windows RCP (Remote Copy Protocol) command is a utility used to copy files between a Windows computer and a remote system. It allows users to transfer files securely over a network using the command-line interface. The RCP command syntax includes the source and destination file paths, along with options for preserving file attributes, quiet mode, and more. By mastering the RCP command, users can efficiently transfer files between systems without the need for a graphical user interface.

## RCP Syntax:
```cmd
rcp [options] source_file destination_file
```
## Options:
| Option | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| -p     | Preserves file modification time |
| -r     | Recursively copies directories   |
| -v     | Verbose output                   |
| -q     | Quiet mode (no output)           |
| -k     | Keep partially copied files      |

## Parameters:
| Parameter        | Description                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| source_file      | File to be copied from            |
| destination_file | Destination file or directory path|

:::caution
Exercise caution when using the rcp command as it transfers files over the network in plain text, making it susceptible to interception. Consider using more secure alternatives like scp or sftp for secure file transfers.

## RCP CMD Examples:
### Copy a File to a Remote Host
```cmd
rcp C:\Users\User1\file.txt RemoteHost:C:\destination\
```
Copies the file "file.txt" from the local machine to a directory on the remote host.

### Copy a Directory to a Remote Host
```cmd
rcp -r C:\Users\User1\folder RemoteHost:C:\destination\
```
Recursively copies the entire directory "folder" from the local machine to a directory on the remote host.

### Copy a File with a Different Name on the Remote Host
```cmd
rcp C:\Users\User1\file.txt RemoteHost:C:\destination\newfile.txt
```
Copies the file "file.txt" from the local machine to the remote host, renaming it as "newfile.txt" in the destination directory.

### Copy a File from a Remote Host to the Local Machine
```cmd
rcp RemoteHost:C:\source\file.txt C:\Users\User1\
```
Copies the file "file.txt" from the remote host to the local machine in the specified directory.

### Display Progress of File Transfer
```cmd
rcp -v C:\Users\User1\file.txt RemoteHost:C:\destination\
```
Copies the file "file.txt" to the remote host while displaying the progress of the transfer.

### Set a Timeout for File Transfer
```cmd
rcp -o -t 60 C:\Users\User1\file.txt RemoteHost:C:\destination\
```
Sets a timeout of 60 seconds for the file transfer to complete, after which it will stop the operation.
:::tip
When using the rcp command in Windows, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the remote system and that the remote system has the rsh service running. Additionally, always ensure that you are aware of the security risks associated with using rcp for file transfers over insecure networks.
