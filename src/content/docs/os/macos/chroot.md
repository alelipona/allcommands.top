title: chroot MacOS command
description: Explore how to use the chroot command on MacOS to change the root directory for a specific process securely.
---

The MacOS chroot command allows users to change the root directory for a specific process, creating a controlled environment. This can be useful for testing or isolating processes, enhancing security by restricting access to certain parts of the filesystem. By using chroot, users can limit the impact of a compromised process and prevent unauthorized access to critical system files. The command is particularly valuable in scenarios where users need to run untrusted applications or services in a confined environment. Additionally, chroot can aid in software development and troubleshooting by providing a sandboxed environment for testing applications.

## chroot Syntax:
```bash
chroot path [command]
