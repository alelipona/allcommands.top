description: Learn how to use the MacOS traceroute command to trace the path that your packets take to a destination IP address.
---

The MacOS traceroute command is a powerful tool used to trace the path that your packets take to a destination IP address. By sending a series of packets with increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) values, traceroute identifies the routers that these packets pass through before reaching the final destination. This command can help you diagnose network issues, identify bottlenecks, and optimize your network performance. With MacOS, you can use the traceroute command in the Terminal to troubleshoot connectivity problems and gain valuable insights into your network topology.
## traceroute Syntax:
```bash
traceroute [ -AcdDeFInrSvx ] [ -f first_ttl ] [ -g gateway ] [ -i interface ] [ -M first_ttl ] [ -m max_ttl ] [ -p port ] [ -q nqueries ] [ -s source_addr ] [ -T tos ] [ -w waittime ] [ -z sendwait ] host [ packetlen ]
```

| -x              | Show maximum time to live (TTL) exceeded replies and ICMP not in the same sequence              |

## Parameters:
| Parameter         | Description                                                                        |

## traceroute Command Samples:
### Basic traceroute
```bash
traceroute www.google.com
```
Performs a traceroute to the website "www.google.com" to determine the route taken by packets across a network.

### Display IP Addresses
```bash
traceroute -n www.facebook.com
```
Performs a traceroute to the website "www.facebook.com" and displays IP addresses instead of hostnames in the output.

### Set Maximum Hops
```bash
traceroute -m 15 www.amazon.com
```
Performs a traceroute to the website "www.amazon.com" with a maximum of 15 hops to reach the destination.

### Use ICMP Echo Requests
```bash
traceroute -I www.reddit.com
```
Performs a traceroute to the website "www.reddit.com" using ICMP echo requests (ping) to probe the intermediate hops.

### Use UDP Packets
```bash
traceroute -U www.twitter.com
```
Performs a traceroute to the website "www.twitter.com" using UDP packets instead of ICMP to determine the route to the destination.

### Display Timestamps
```bash
traceroute -T www.apple.com
```
Performs a traceroute to the website "www.apple.com" and displays timestamps in the output to analyze the round-trip times of packets.

### Set Packet Size
```bash
traceroute -s 1000 www.microsoft.com

:::tip
When using the traceroute command in MacOS, keep in mind that the output might vary based on the network configuration and the target destination. It's also important to familiarize yourself with the available options to customize the traceroute command according to your needs.
