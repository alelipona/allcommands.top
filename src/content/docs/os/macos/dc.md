description: Learn how to use the dc command on MacOS for arbitrary-precision arithmetic calculations. Understand its functions and syntax.
---

The dc command on MacOS is a versatile tool for performing complex mathematical calculations with arbitrary precision. It uses a reverse Polish notation approach, where operators follow the operands. This allows for efficient calculation of various mathematical expressions, making it a powerful utility for scripting and automation tasks.

## dc Syntax:
```bash
dc [options] [operands]
```

## dc Options:
| Option          | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| -e expression   | Specify a calculation expression to be executed  |
| -f file         | Read input from the specified file               |
| -o              | Output results in octal format                   |
| -i              | Ignore invalid characters in input               |
| -S              | Operate in stack-only mode                      |
| -r              | Output results in radians                        |
| -D              | Output results in debug format                   |
| -T              | Output results in trace format                   |

## Parameters:
| Parameter    | Description                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| expression   | Calculation expression to be evaluated |
| file         | File containing input operands   |
| operands     | Operands for the calculation     |
