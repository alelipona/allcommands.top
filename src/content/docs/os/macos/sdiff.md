The sdiff command in MacOS allows users to compare two text files side by side, highlighting the differences between them. This can be extremely useful for identifying changes between two versions of a file, merging changes, or resolving conflicts. By default, sdiff shows the lines that differ between the two files, but it also provides options for customizing the output format. Users can specify how to display changes, ignore whitespace, and handle merges. Additionally, sdiff can be used in conjunction with other commands and features in MacOS, such as piping output or redirecting output to a file. Overall, sdiff is a versatile and powerful tool for text file comparison and merging in the MacOS environment.

:::caution
Exercise caution when using sdiff command as it directly compares files and highlights the differences in a side-by-side format, which can be overwhelming for large files or complex comparisons.

## sdiff bash Examples:
### Compare two text files
```bash
sdiff file1.txt file2.txt
```
Compares the contents of two text files and highlights the differences.

### Ignore leading white spaces
```bash
sdiff -w40 file1.txt file2.txt
```
Compares two files but ignores differences in leading white spaces up to 40 characters.

### Side by side output
```bash
sdiff -s file1.txt file2.txt
```
Displays the differences in a side by side format for easy comparison.

### Suppress common lines
```bash
sdiff -l file1.txt file2.txt
```
Shows only the differing lines and suppresses common lines from the output.

### Merge changes interactively
```bash
sdiff -o output.txt -e file1.txt file2.txt
```
Interactive mode to merge changes from two files into an output file.

### Define a custom separator
```bash
sdiff -t "| " file1.txt file2.txt
```
Uses a custom separator ("| ") instead of the default tab to display differences.
:::tip
When using the sdiff command in MacOS, make sure to carefully review the output as it highlights the differences between two files. Understanding the symbols used in the output ('<' for lines unique to the first file, '>' for lines unique to the second file, etc.) is crucial for interpreting the comparison accurately.
