---

The MacOS `until` bash command is used to process text files line by line efficiently. It allows users to execute a set of commands until a specified condition is met. By using the `until` command, you can create loops that will continue running until a certain process or condition is achieved. This can be useful for automating tasks or performing repetitive actions in a script. The `until` command can help streamline processes and improve productivity when working with text files in the MacOS terminal.

## until Syntax:
```bash
until [CONDITION] ; do [COMMANDS]; done
```

## Options:
| Option | Description                  |
|--------|------------------------------|
| -c     | Count the number of loops    |
| -r     | Reverse the loop condition    |
| -f     | Force the loop to continue   |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CONDITION | The condition under which the loop continues  |
| COMMANDS  | The command(s) to be executed in each loop    |

:::caution
Be careful when using the `until` command to ensure that the loop condition can be met to avoid infinite looping.

### Print Numbers from 1 to 5
```bash
num=1; until [ $num -gt 5 ]; do echo $num; ((num++)); done
```
Prints numbers from 1 to 5 using the "until" loop.

### Backup a Directory Until a Certain Date
```bash
until [[ $(date +%Y-%m-%d) == "2022-12-31" ]]; do cp -r /path/to/directory /path/to/backup; done
```
Backs up a directory until a specific date ("2022-12-31") is reached using the "until" loop.

### Check Disk Space Availability
```bash
until [[ $(df -h | grep '/dev/disk1' | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d'%' -f1) -gt 80 ]]; do echo "Disk space is below 80%, continue monitoring..."; sleep 30; done
```
Checks disk space availability on disk1 and continues monitoring until it exceeds 80% using the "until" loop.

### Download a File Until Successful
```bash
until curl -O http://example.com/file.txt; do echo "Download failed, retrying..."; sleep 5; done
```
Downloads a file from a URL until the download is successful using the "until" loop.

:::tip
When using the until command in MacOS, make sure to properly define the condition that needs to be met for the loop to stop. Always test your code to ensure that the loop behaves as expected.

## Common Questions on until Usage:
### How do I use until in MacOS?
To use the until command in MacOS, execute the following command:
```bash
until [[ $x -eq 5 ]]; do
    echo "x is $x"
    ((x++))
done
```

### How can I use until to run a command until successful in MacOS?
You can use the until command to run another command until it succeeds in MacOS. Here's an example:
```bash
until command_that_might_fail; do
    sleep 1
done
```

### How do I use until with multiple conditions in MacOS?
To use until with multiple conditions in MacOS, you can combine them with logical operators. Here's an example:
```bash
until [[ $x -eq 5 && $y -lt 3 ]]; do
    echo "x is $x, y is $y"
    ((x++))
    ((y++))
done
```

### How can I break out of an until loop in MacOS?
To break out of an until loop in MacOS, you can use the break statement. Here's an example:
```bash
until [[ $x -eq 5 ]]; do
    if conditions_met; then
        break
    fi
done
```

### How do I use the continue statement with until in MacOS?
You can use the continue statement to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration in an until loop in MacOS. Here's an example:
```bash
until [[ $x -eq 5 ]]; do
    ((x++))
    if condition_met; then
        continue
    fi
    echo "x is $x"
done
```

### How do I use until with a command substitution in MacOS?
To use until with a command substitution in MacOS, you can include the command substitution within the condition. Here's an example:
```bash
until [[ $(command_to_check) -eq 0 ]]; do
    do_something
done
```

### How can I nest until loops in MacOS?
You can nest until loops in MacOS by including one until loop inside another. Here's an example:
```bash
until [[ condition1 ]]; do
    do_something1
    until [[ condition2 ]]; do
        do_something2
    done
done
```

## Applications of the until command

1. Repeating a set of commands until a specific condition is met.
2. Automating tasks that require repetitive execution until a certain criteria is satisfied.
3. Batch processing multiple files or data sets until a desired outcome is achieved.
4. Implementing loops and conditional statements for complex logic flow in shell scripts.
5. Continuously running a script or set of commands until a termination condition is reached.
