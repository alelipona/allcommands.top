:::tip
When using the select command in MacOS, make sure to provide a list of options for the user to choose from. This can be achieved by specifying the options directly in the command or by using variables to hold the options. Additionally, always ensure that the select command is used within a loop to continuously display the menu until a valid option is selected.
