description: Learn how to use the MacOS caller command to display the execution stack of a shell script. Find out about its options and usage.
---

The MacOS caller command is a useful tool for displaying the execution stack of a shell script. By using this command, you can see the list of function calls leading to the current point in the script. This can be helpful for debugging purposes and understanding the flow of your script. The caller command can provide valuable information about the functions that have been executed and their order, helping you to trace back the sequence of events in your script.
## caller Syntax:
```bash
du [option] [directory]
```
## MacOS caller Options:
| Option | Description              |
|--------|--------------------------|
| -h     | Human-readable output    |
| -s     | Display only a total for each argument            |
| -c     | Display a grand total for all arguments                 |

## caller Parameters:
| Parameter | Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| directory | Specifies the directory to analyze             |

:::caution
Exercise caution when using the "du" command as it can consume a substantial amount of system resources, especially when analyzing large directories.

## How to use caller command:
### Determine the calling function
```bash
caller
```
Displays the line number and source file name of the calling function.

### Call a script with arguments
```bash
caller ./script.sh arg1 arg2
```
Executes a script with specified arguments and displays the line number and source file name of the function that called it.

### Capture output of the caller command
```bash
caller > caller_output.txt
```
Redirects the output of the caller command to a file named "caller_output.txt".

### Use caller with grep
```bash
caller | grep "function_name"
```
Filters the output of the caller command to display only lines containing the specified function name.

### Pipe the output of caller to a command
```bash
caller | wc -l
```
Counts the number of lines in the output of the caller command.

### Combine caller with if statement
```bash
if [ "$(caller)" == "0 ./script.sh" ]; then
    echo "Script is being run directly"
else
    echo "Script is being called from another function"
fi
```
Checks if the script is being run directly or called from another function using the caller command.

### Use caller to get the call stack
```bash
caller; caller 1; caller 2
```
Displays the call stack by showing the line numbers and source file names of up to three calling functions.

### Call a function recursively with caller
```bash
function_name() {
    # Some code
    caller
    if [ condition ]; then
        function_name
    fi
}
function_name
```
Calls a function recursively and displays the line number and source file name of each calling instance using the caller command.
:::tip
When using the caller command in MacOS, make sure to consult the manual pages (man pages) for detailed information on available options and their usage. This can be accessed by running `man caller` in the terminal.
