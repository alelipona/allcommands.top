The MacOS kextstat command is a powerful tool for managing kernel extensions on your system. By using this command, you can easily check which kernel extensions are currently loaded, their status, and other relevant information. This can be extremely helpful for troubleshooting issues related to kernel extensions, as well as for monitoring and managing the extensions on your system. The kextstat command provides detailed information about each loaded kernel extension, including its bundle ID, version, address, size, and dependencies. By analyzing this information, you can gain insights into how your system is utilizing kernel extensions and identify any potential conflicts or issues. Additionally, the kextstat command allows you to filter and display specific types of kernel extensions, making it easier to focus on the ones that are of interest to you. Overall, the kextstat command is a valuable tool for any MacOS user who wants to take control of their system's kernel extensions and ensure optimal performance and stability.

## kextstat bash Examples:
### Displaying a list of all loaded kernel extensions
```bash
kextstat
```
This command will list all the currently loaded kernel extensions on the macOS system.

### Displaying a list of loaded kernel extensions in verbose mode
```bash
kextstat -l
```
Using the -l option with kextstat will display additional information about the loaded kernel extensions in verbose mode.

### Viewing just the loaded kernel extensions from a specific vendor
```bash
kextstat | grep -i vendor
```
This command will filter kextstat output to display only the loaded kernel extensions from a specific vendor, as specified by "vendor".

### Searching for a specific kernel extension by name
```bash
kextstat | grep -i "example.kext"
```
By using the grep command, you can search for a specific kernel extension (example.kext in this case) within the kextstat output.

### Displaying only the loaded kernel extensions with their bundle identifiers
```bash
kextstat -b
```
Running kextstat with the -b option will display the loaded kernel extensions along with their respective bundle identifiers.

### Checking the status of a specific kernel extension
```bash
kextstat -l | grep -i "com.example.kext"
```
By using the -l option with kextstat and filtering with grep, you can check the status of a specific kernel extension (com.example.kext in this case).
:::tip
When using the kextstat command in MacOS, make sure to carefully review the output to understand the loaded kernel extensions on your system. This can help diagnose issues related to hardware, drivers, and system stability.
