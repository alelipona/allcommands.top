The read command waits for the user to input data followed by pressing the Enter key. This command is useful for creating interactive scripts and handling user input in a shell script. It allows you to store the input in a variable for further processing within the script. The read command in MacOS provides a simple and efficient way to interact with users and process input data in shell scripts.
