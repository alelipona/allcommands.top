---

The MacOS join command is used to merge lines of two sorted files based on a common field. By default, it uses the first field to join the lines. It can be particularly useful for combining data from different sources into a single file. The command requires the input files to be sorted in ascending order based on the field used for joining. The join command also provides options to specify the input field separators and the output field separators. Additionally, it allows for customizing the fields to be displayed in the output.
## join Syntax:
```bash
join [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2
```
## Options:
| Option | Description               |
|--------|---------------------------|
| -a FILE| also print unpairable lines from FILE |
| -e EMPTY| replace missing input fields with EMPTY |
| -i | ignore differences in case when comparing fields |
| -j FIELD| equivalent to '-1 FIELD -2 FIELD' |
| -o FORMAT| obey FORMAT while constructing output line |
| -t CHAR| use CHAR as input and output field separator |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description               |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| FILE1 | the first file to be joined |
| FILE2 | the second file to be joined |
