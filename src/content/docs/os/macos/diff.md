description: Learn how to use the MacOS diff command to compare files and directories efficiently. Improve your file comparison process with this powerful tool.
---

The MacOS diff command is a tool used to compare files line by line. It highlights the differences between two files and shows which lines are unique to each file. This command can be used to compare text files, directories, and binary files. By default, the output of the diff command shows the differing lines between the two files. There are various options available to customize the output format and control the behavior of the command. The MacOS diff command is a useful utility for developers, system administrators, and anyone who needs to compare files and identify changes quickly.

## diff Syntax:
```bash
diff [option] file1 file2
```

## Options:
| Option | Description                  |
|--------|------------------------------|
| -q     | Output only whether files differ |
| -r     | Recursively compare any subdirectories found   |
| -u     | Output in unified format     |
| -y     | Output in two-column format  |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| file1     | Path to the first file to be compared       |
| file2     | Path to the second file to be compared      |

:::caution
Exercise caution while using the diff command as it directly compares the content of two files or directories.

## diff bash Examples:

### Compare Two Text Files
```bash
diff file1.txt file2.txt
```
Compares two text files "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" and displays the differences between them.

### Show Differences Between Two Directories
```bash
diff -rq dir1 dir2
```
Recursively compares the contents of directories "dir1" and "dir2" and displays the files that differ between them.

### Ignore Case Sensitivity
```bash
diff -i file1.txt file2.txt
```
Compares two text files "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" while ignoring differences in case sensitivity.

### Display Differences in Unified Format
```bash
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
```
Compares two text files "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" and displays the differences in the unified format.

### Create Patch File
```bash
diff -u original_file modified_file > changes.patch
```
Creates a patch file named "changes.patch" that contains the differences between "original_file" and "modified_file".

### Compare Files Recursively
```bash
diff -r dir1 dir2
```
Compares the files in directories "dir1" and "dir2" recursively and displays the differences between them.
:::tip
When using the diff command in MacOS, remember that it is primarily used to compare files line by line. The command highlights the differences between two files in a side-by-side format, making it easier to identify discrepancies. It is a powerful tool for spotting changes in code, configurations, or any text-based files.
