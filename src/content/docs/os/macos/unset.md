description: Learn how to use the MacOS unset command to remove environment variables and paths from your shell session.
---

The MacOS unset command is used to remove environment variables and paths from your shell session. This can be helpful for cleaning up your environment or for troubleshooting issues related to conflicting variables. By using unset, you can effectively remove specific variables that may be causing issues or simply declutter your environment. This command is particularly useful when you no longer need a certain variable or when you want to reset a variable to its default value. Keep in mind that unset only affects the current shell session, so any changes made will not persist once you close the session.

## unset Syntax:
```bash
unset [option] [parameter]
