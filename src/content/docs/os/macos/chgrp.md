description: Learn how to use the chgrp command in MacOS to change the group ownership of files and directories. 
---

The chgrp command in MacOS allows users to change the group ownership of files and directories. This can be useful for managing permissions and access control within a Unix-based system. By specifying a new group, users can easily transfer ownership to a different group, granting them specific permissions. The chgrp command works similarly to the chown command, but it specifically focuses on changing the group ownership without affecting other attributes. This command is especially handy for system administrators and developers who need to manage user groups efficiently.

## chgrp Syntax:
```bash
chgrp [option] group file/directory
```

## Options:
| Option       | Description                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| -R, --recursive | operate on files/directories recursively         |
| -H           | follow symbolic links                          |
| -L           | traverse every symbolic link encountered         |
| -P           | do not traverse any symbolic links (default)   |

## Parameters:
| Parameter    | Description                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| group        | specify the group ownership                     |
