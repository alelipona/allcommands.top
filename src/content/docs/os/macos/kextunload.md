---

The MacOS kextunload command is used to unload kernel extensions on a Mac system. Kernel extensions are pieces of code that enhance the operating system's functionality and help it communicate with hardware devices. With kextunload, users can unload these extensions when they are no longer needed, freeing up system resources and potentially resolving conflicts. This command can be particularly useful when troubleshooting issues related to hardware devices and drivers. By unloading specific kernel extensions, users can isolate problematic components and streamline the system's operation. It is important to note that using the kextunload command requires administrative privileges and should be done with caution to avoid disrupting system stability.

## kextunload Syntax:
```bash
kextunload [-b bundle_id] [-v] [-V] [-c bundle_id] [-t] [-q] [-b bundle_id [-v[v] [-t] [-q]]] [-h] [bundle_id ...]
```

## Options:
| Option                 | Description                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| -b bundle_id           | Specifies the bundle ID of the kext to be unloaded         |
| -v                     | Verbose output, display progress                           |
| -V                     | Very verbose output, display even more information        |
| -c bundle_id           | Unload the bundle specified and its dependents if possible |
| -t                     | Test the kexts (unload will not occur)                     |
| -q                     | Quiet, print only errors and warnings                      |

|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| bundle_id  | One or more kext bundle IDs to be unloaded               |
