description: Learn how to use the MacOS nohup command to run processes in the background without being terminated when the shell is closed.
---

The MacOS nohup command allows users to run processes in the background without being terminated when the shell is closed. This can be useful when running long-running tasks that should not be interrupted. By using nohup, users can detach the process from the current shell, ensuring it continues running even after logging out. This command is especially handy for running scripts or commands that take a significant amount of time to complete. To use nohup, simply prepend it to the command or script you want to run. Additionally, users can redirect the output of the process to a file to review later. Overall, the nohup command is a valuable tool for managing tasks on a MacOS system, providing flexibility and convenience in handling background processes.
## nohup Syntax:
```bash
nohup command [options] [parameters] &
```
## Options:

| Option  | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| -n     | Ignore if the nohup.out file already exists and opens a new one for logging |
| -p     | Allows setting a new process group ID from the specified one |

## Parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|

:::caution
Running commands with `nohup` can detach them from the current shell session. Be cautious as these processes will continue running even if you log out. Always double-check the commands and options used with `nohup` to avoid unintended consequences.

## nohup Command Samples:

### Execute a Command in the Background
```bash
nohup ./script.sh &
```
Runs the script "script.sh" in the background using nohup.

### Create a Log File for the Command Output
```bash
nohup python app.py > output.log &
```
Executes the Python script "app.py" using nohup and redirects the output to a log file named "output.log".

### Run a Command Even after Logging Out
```bash
nohup ./process.sh &
```
Starts the process defined in "process.sh" using nohup, ensuring it continues to run even after logging out.

### Continuously Execute a Command
```bash
nohup watch -n 60 'date' > date.log &
```
Uses nohup to continuously execute the "date" command every 60 seconds, redirecting the output to a file named "date.log".

### Ignore Hangup Signals
```bash
nohup ./long_process.sh &
```
Starts the long-running process "long_process.sh" with nohup, ignoring hangup signals.

### Run Multiple Commands in Sequence
```bash
nohup sh -c 'command1; command2; command3' &
```
Executes a sequence of commands (command1, command2, command3) using nohup in a single line.

### Check the Command's Status
```bash
nohup ./backup.sh > backup.log 2>&1 &
```
Initiates the backup process using nohup and directs both standard output and error output to a log file for status monitoring.
:::tip
Remember to always provide a valid command or script to run after the `nohup` command to ensure it continues running even after you close the terminal.
