title: which MacOS command
description: Find out where a specific command is located within the MacOS system using the which command.
---

The which command in MacOS is used to locate the path of a specific executable file within the operating system. By typing "which" followed by the command name, you can determine the exact location of that command in the system's directories. This can be helpful in situations where you have multiple versions of a program installed, or if you want to ensure that you are running the correct version. The which command searches through the directories listed in the PATH environment variable to find the specified command. It will display the full path to the executable file if it is found, or provide no output if the command is not located in any of the directories.

## which Syntax:
```bash
which [option] [command]
```

## which Options:
| Option | Description                   |

| -a     | Print all instances of the command found in the user's PATH. |
| -s     | Only print the first instance of the command found in the user's PATH. |
| -h     | Display help and exit. |
