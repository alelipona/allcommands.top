---

The MacOS alloc command is used to allocate memory in scripts for various purposes such as creating temporary data structures or buffering data for processing. This command can be particularly useful when working with large datasets or when efficiency is crucial. By using the alloc command, you can optimize your scripts to make the most efficient use of available memory, ultimately improving the performance of your code. Additionally, the alloc command allows you to specify the size and alignment of the allocated memory, giving you more control over how your script utilizes system resources.

## alloc Syntax:
```bash
alloc [-h] [-o output_file] [-s size] [-t template_file]
```

## Options:
| Option          | Description                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| -h              | Display help message               |
| -o output_file  | Specify the output file            |
| -s size         | Specify the size of the allocation |
| -t template_file| Specify a template file            |

## Parameters:
| Parameter       | Description                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| -h              | Help                               |
| -o output_file  | Output file name                   |
| -s size         | Size of allocation in bytes        |
| -t template_file| Template file name                 |
