```bash
csplit [options] [file] [pattern]...
```

## csplit Options:
| Option | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| -b     | Use suffix template for output   |
| -f     | Use prefix template for output   |
| -k     | Retain files with no matches     |
| -n     | Use specified number of digits   |
| -z     | Do not remove empty output files |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| file      | The input file to split               |
| pattern   | The pattern to match in the input file|

:::caution

## csplit Command Usage Examples:
### Split a File into Two Separate Files Based on a Specific Pattern
```bash
csplit input.txt '/pattern/' '{1}'
```
Splits the file "input.txt" into two separate files at the line containing "pattern".

### Split a File into Multiple Files Based on Line Count
```bash
csplit input.txt 100 '{*}'
```
Divides the file "input.txt" into multiple files, each with 100 lines.

### Extract Specific Sections from a File into Separate Files
```bash
csplit input.txt '/start_pattern/' '/end_pattern/' '{*}'
```
Creates separate files for each section of "input.txt" between "start_pattern" and "end_pattern".

### Split a File Based on RegEx Patterns
```bash
csplit input.log '/ERROR/' '{*}'
```
Splits the log file "input.log" into multiple files, each containing lines with the pattern "ERROR".

### Split a File by Bytes
```bash
csplit input.bin 500 '{*}'
```
Divides the binary file "input.bin" into multiple files, each with a size of 500 bytes.
