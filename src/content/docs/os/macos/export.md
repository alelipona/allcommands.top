The export command in MacOS is used to set environment variables that define the environment of the current shell session.

This command is particularly useful for setting variables that are needed by multiple programs or scripts. It allows you to define variables with specific values and make them available to any program that is executed within the shell session. Additionally, the export command can be used to view a list of all currently defined environment variables. Overall, the export command is a versatile tool for managing environment variables and customizing your shell settings in MacOS.
