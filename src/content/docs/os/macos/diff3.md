The MacOS diff3 command is a tool used in the Terminal to compare and merge three files. It shows the differences between the original file and the two modified versions, highlighting conflicts that need to be resolved. By using the diff3 command, you can easily identify discrepancies and make informed decisions when merging files. This command is particularly useful for developers working on collaborative projects or anyone managing multiple versions of the same file.

## diff3 Syntax:

| -E             | Like -e, but includes conflict markers |

| file2          | The second file to compare for differences  |
| file3          | The third file to compare for differences   |

## diff3 Usage:
### Basic Usage
```bash
diff3 file1 file2 file3
```
Compares three files and shows the differences between them.

### Merge Changes from Two Different Files
```bash
diff3 -m file1 file2 file3
```
Merges changes from `file1` and `file2` into `file3`.

### Ignore White Space Changes
```bash
diff3 -E file1 file2 file3
```
Compares three files while ignoring changes in white spaces.

### Show Only Conflicts
```bash
diff3 -x file1 file2 file3
```
Display only the conflicting changes between the three files.
:::tip
When using the diff3 command in MacOS, remember to carefully review the differences in the files and any conflicts that arise during the merge process. Utilize the various options available to customize the output and resolve conflicts effectively.
