## asr bash Examples:
### Create a Disk Image from a Source
```bash
asr -source /Volumes/SourceDrive -target /Volumes/DestinationDrive/DiskImage.dmg
```
Creates a disk image from a specified source drive and saves it to a destination drive.

### Restore a Disk Image to a Target Drive
```bash
asr -source /Volumes/DiskImage.dmg -target /Volumes/TargetDrive
```
Restores a disk image from a specified source to a target drive.

### Verify the Integrity of a Disk Image
```bash
asr imagescan --source /Volumes/DiskImage.dmg
```
Verifies the integrity of a disk image by scanning it for any issues.

### Clone a Source Drive to a Target Drive
```bash
sudo asr -source /dev/disk1 -target /dev/disk2 --erase
```
Clones the data from a source drive to a target drive while erasing the target drive.

### Split a Disk Image into Segments
```bash
asr --source /Volumes/DiskImage.dmg --target /Volumes/SegmentedDiskImage.dmg --chunk-size 1G
```
Splits a disk image into segments of a specified size for easier storage or distribution.

### Get Information About a Disk Image
```bash
asr imageinfo /Volumes/DiskImage.dmg
```
Displays detailed information about a disk image, such as size, format, and encryption status.
