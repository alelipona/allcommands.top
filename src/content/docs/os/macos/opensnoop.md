description: Learn how to use the opensnoop command in MacOS to trace filesystem activity and monitor file opens in real-time. 
---

The opensnoop command in MacOS allows users to trace filesystem activity and monitor file opens in real-time. By using this command, you can view detailed information about the processes that are opening files on your system. This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues related to file access or identifying potentially malicious activity on your Mac. Opensnoop provides a convenient way to track down which applications are accessing specific files at any given moment.

## opensnoop Syntax:
```bash
opensnoop [pid] [command]
```

## MacOS opensnoop Options:
| Option | Description                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| -n     | Specified number of events    |
| -d     | Duration to trace (in seconds)|
| -p     | Only trace specific PID       |
| -c     | Only trace specific command   |

## opensnoop Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                                                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
