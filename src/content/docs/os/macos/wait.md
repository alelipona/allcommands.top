The MacOS wait command is used to pause a shell script until all background processes are complete. By utilizing this command, you can ensure that specific tasks are done before proceeding with the rest of the script. This can be particularly useful when you have multiple commands running in the background and need to wait for all of them to finish before continuing. The wait command helps to synchronize the execution of various processes, allowing you to control the flow of your script effectively.

## wait Syntax:
```bash
wait [process_id]
```

## Parameters:
| Parameter  | Description                                 |

## wait Command Usage Examples:
### Execute a Command After a Delay
```bash
echo "Starting..."
wait 5
echo "Delayed message after 5 seconds"
```
Executes the first echo command immediately, then waits for 5 seconds before displaying the second echo message.

### Delay Script Execution
```bash
echo "Script start..."
wait 10
echo "Script end."
```
Displays the "Script start..." message, waits for 10 seconds, then prints "Script end."

### Wait Before Starting a Program
```bash
echo "Launching app..."
wait 3 && open /Applications/Safari.app
```
Prints "Launching app..." then waits for 3 seconds before opening the Safari application.

### Schedule a Task after a Delay
```bash
echo "Task scheduled at $(date)"
wait 60 && echo "Task executed at $(date)"
```
Displays the current time, waits for 60 seconds, then shows the time the task was executed.

### Implement a Countdown Timer
```bash
for i in {5..1}; do
    echo "Starting in $i seconds..."
    wait 1
done
echo "Start!"
```
Prints a countdown message from 5 to 1, waiting one second between each message before displaying "Start!"
:::tip
Make sure to specify the process ID (PID) or job ID after the wait command to wait for a specific process or job to complete.

```bash
command1 &
command2 &
wait <PID1>
wait <PID2>
```

### Can I use the wait command with a timeout in MacOS?
Yes, you can use the timeout command in conjunction with the wait command to set a timeout for waiting. Here's an example:
```bash

timeout 10 wait <PID>
```

### How to perform actions after waiting using wait in MacOS?
You can execute commands or scripts after the wait command by placing them after the wait command in your script. Here is an example:
```bash
command &
wait <PID>
echo "Process completed successfully."
```

### How to use the wait command in a loop in MacOS?

```bash
command &
wait <PID>
```
