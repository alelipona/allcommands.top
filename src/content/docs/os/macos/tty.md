### Check Current TTY Device
```bash
tty
```
Displays the file name of the terminal connected to the standard input.

### Switch to a Different Virtual Terminal
```bash
tty
```
Switches to a different virtual console to perform tasks away from the graphical interface.

### Print the Name of the Controlling Terminal
```bash
tty -s
```
Prints the file name of the terminal connected to the standard input in a quiet mode.

### Get the Device File Associated with Standard Input
```bash
tty < input.txt
```
Returns the file name of the terminal associated with the standard input, when input is redirected from a file.

### Check if Input is a Terminal
```bash
test -t 0 && echo "Input is a terminal" || echo "Input is not a terminal"
