This can be beneficial in scenarios where efficiency and performance are key, as it eliminates the need to create a new process for the new program. By using the exec command, the current process is effectively replaced by the new program, allowing for a seamless transition and optimal resource utilization. The exec command is commonly used in shell scripts and programming languages to streamline processes and enhance overall system performance.

### Switch to a Different Shell
```bash
exec /usr/bin/zsh
```
Changes the current shell to Z shell (/usr/bin/zsh) by replacing the existing shell process.

### Run a Compiled Program
```bash
exec ./myprogram
```
Replaces the shell process with the binary executable “myprogram”, allowing it to run in place of the shell environment.
