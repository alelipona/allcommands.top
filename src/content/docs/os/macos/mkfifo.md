description: Learn how to use the mkfifo command on MacOS to create FIFO special files. Understand the syntax, options, and practical use cases.
---

The `mkfifo` command in MacOS is used to create FIFO special files, also known as named pipes. These pipes allow inter-process communication between processes running on the same machine. By using the `mkfifo` command, you can create a FIFO file with the specified name. This can be useful when you need to pass data or messages between different processes in a synchronized way.

To use the `mkfifo` command, you simply need to provide the desired name for the FIFO file as an argument. Once the FIFO file is created, processes can write data to it using standard input/output operations. This allows for seamless communication between processes without the need for temporary files.

The `mkfifo` command can be particularly useful in situations where you need to pass data between processes efficiently and securely. By creating a FIFO file using `mkfifo`, you can establish a communication channel that allows processes to exchange data in real-time.

Overall, the `mkfifo` command in MacOS is a handy tool for creating FIFO special files that facilitate inter-process communication. By understanding how to use `mkfifo` effectively, you can enhance the efficiency and flexibility of your workflows that involve passing data between processes.

## mkfifo Syntax:
```bash
mkfifo [option] [parameter]
```

## Options:
| Option | Description                        |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| -m     | Set the file permission mode (default is 0666) |

## Parameters:
| Parameter  | Description                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| filename   | Specifies the name of the FIFO (First In First Out) |

:::caution
Caution: Use mkfifo command carefully as it creates FIFO special files. Improper usage may lead to unexpected behavior or data loss.

## mkfifo Command Samples:
### Create a FIFO file
```bash
mkfifo myfifo
```
This command creates a first in, first out (FIFO) special file named "myfifo".

### Use a FIFO file as input to a command
```bash
cat myfifo | less
```
This command reads the content of the FIFO file "myfifo" and pipes it into the "less" command for easy navigation.

### Use a FIFO file as output from a command
```bash
ls -l > myfifo &
```
This command directs the output of the "ls -l" command into the FIFO file "myfifo" in the background.

### Redirect input to a FIFO file
```bash
mkfifo input
cat > input
```
These commands create a FIFO file named "input" and redirect the standard input into this file.

### Use multiple FIFO files in a pipeline
```bash
mkfifo pipe1 pipe2
ls -l | tee pipe1 | sort | tee pipe2
```
In this pipeline, multiple FIFO files ("pipe1" and "pipe2") are used to pass data between commands in a structured manner.

### Read from a FIFO file in a loop
```bash
mkfifo log
while true; do cat log; sleep 1; done
```
This command creates a FIFO file "log" and continuously reads and displays any data written to it in a loop with a one-second delay between each read.

### Write to a FIFO file
```bash
mkfifo output
echo "Hello, FIFO!" > output
```
In this example, the text "Hello, FIFO!" is written to the FIFO file "output".
:::tip
When using the `mkfifo` command in MacOS, ensure you have the necessary permissions to create the named pipe in the desired directory.

## mkfifo FAQ:
### How do I use mkfifo in MacOS?
To use the mkfifo command in MacOS, execute the following command:
```bash
mkfifo /path/to/named_pipe
```

### What is the purpose of mkfifo in MacOS?
The `mkfifo` command in MacOS is used to create named pipes (FIFOs) for interprocess communication.

### How can I create a named pipe with mkfifo in MacOS?
To create a named pipe using `mkfifo` in MacOS, use the following command:
```bash
mkfifo my_pipe
```

### How do I check if a named pipe already exists in MacOS?
To check if a named pipe already exists in MacOS, you can use the `-e` option with the `test` command like this:
```bash
test -p my_pipe && echo "Named pipe exists" || echo "Named pipe does not exist"
```

### Can I specify permissions when creating a named pipe with mkfifo in MacOS?
Yes, you can specify permissions when creating a named pipe in MacOS using the `-m` option with the `mkfifo` command. For example:
```bash
mkfifo -m 600 my_pipe
```

### Is there a way to remove a named pipe created with mkfifo in MacOS?
Yes, you can remove a named pipe created with `mkfifo` in MacOS using the `rm` command. For example:
```bash
rm my_pipe
```
## Applications of the mkfifo command

- Create named pipe
- Allow communication between processes
- Implement inter-process communication
