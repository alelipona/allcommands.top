## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                  |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| list      | List of items to iterate over|
| command   | Command to execute for each item|

:::caution
Be cautious with the use of for loops as they can lead to unintended consequences if not implemented correctly. Avoid manipulating critical system files or directories with for loops.
