The Linux visudo command is a crucial tool for system administrators to safely edit the sudoers file. This command opens the sudoers file in a protected environment, allowing users to modify it without the risk of breaking sudo functionality. By using visudo, administrators can define which users or groups have sudo privileges, specify the commands they can run with elevated permissions, and set other sudo configurations. Properly configuring the sudoers file with visudo is essential for enforcing security policies and managing user permissions effectively in Linux systems.

visudo [ -c ] [ -f file ] [ -q ] [ -s ] [ -V ]
