description: Learn how to format a storage device with the Linux mkfs command. Understand the options and syntax for creating a new filesystem.
---

The Linux mkfs command is used to create a new filesystem on a storage device. It allows users to format a block-based device with the specified filesystem type, such as ext4 or xfs. The mkfs command offers various options and allows customization of the filesystem parameters, such as block size, journaling, and metadata options. By understanding the syntax and available options of the mkfs command, users can efficiently manage and format storage devices according to their requirements.
## mkfs Syntax:
```bash
mkfs [options] [parameters]
```
## Options:

| Option           | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| -t <type>        | Specify the type of file system to create (e.g., ext4, xfs). |
| -c               | Perform bad blocks scan during formatting.|
| -l <label>       | Assign a label to the file system.     |
| -n               | Do not create the file system, show what would be done. |
| -F               | Force operation even if not safe.      |
| -V               | Verbose mode - show progress.          |
| -q               | Quiet mode - suppress output.          |
| --               | Indicates the end of options.          |

## Parameters:

| Parameter        | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| device           | The block device to format.            |
| inode_count      | The number of inodes to allocate.      |
| block_count      | The number of blocks to allocate.      |
| block_size       | The size of a block in bytes.          |
| inode_size       | The size of an inode in bytes.         |
| label            | The label for the file system.         |
| reserved_blocks  | The amount of space reserved for super-user. |
| block_group_size | The size of cylinder groups in blocks. |
| stride           | The number of filesystem blocks that should be read or written together. |
| stripe_width     | The number of blocks in a stripe of the RAID. |
| stripe_width     | The number of blocks in a stripe of the RAID. |  

:::caution
Exercise caution while using the mkfs command as it will format the specified device, resulting in all data on that device being lost permanently.

```
Formats the partition /dev/sdg1 with the NTFS file system.
:::tip
When using the mkfs command in Linux, make sure to specify the correct filesystem type (e.g., ext4, xfs, etc.) and understand that this command will format the specified device, erasing all data on it.
