The Linux yes command is a simple utility that outputs a string or character specified as an argument, repeatedly. It is often used in scripts for automation, as well as for generating a continuous stream of a specific input. The yes command can be helpful in various scenarios, such as confirming prompts in batch scripts or providing continuous input for testing purposes. It is a straightforward tool that can be useful in a variety of scripting and automation tasks.

## yes Syntax:
```bash
