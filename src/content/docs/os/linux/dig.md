description: Learn how to use the Linux dig command to query DNS-related information, such as IP addresses and domain information, from the command line.
---

The Linux dig command is a powerful tool used for querying Domain Name System (DNS) servers. It can provide detailed information about various DNS records, such as IP addresses, name servers, and more. By default, dig provides a lot of information, including the query time, the server that provided the response, and the flags used in the query. It can be used to troubleshoot DNS-related issues, verify DNS configurations, and gather DNS-related information. With its flexibility and extensive features, the Linux dig command is a valuable tool for network administrators and anyone working with DNS infrastructure.

dig www.example.com
```
This command performs a basic DNS lookup for the domain "www.example.com".

### Perform a reverse DNS lookup
```bash
dig -x 8.8.8.8
```
Performs a reverse DNS lookup for the IP address "8.8.8.8" to find the associated domain name.

### Query a specific DNS server
```bash
dig @8.8.4.4 www.example.com
```
Queries the DNS server at IP address "8.8.4.4" specifically for the domain "www.example.com".

### Display more detailed output
```bash
dig +trace www.example.com
```
Displays a more detailed output by tracing the DNS query for the domain "www.example.com".
