title: Chaosreader Linux command
description: A comprehensive guide to using the Linux chaosreader command for analyzing network traffic and extracting content from pcap files.
---

Chaosreader is a powerful command-line tool in Linux used for analyzing network traffic captured in pcap files. It can extract and decode various protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and more, providing valuable insights into the data being transmitted. By converting the raw packet data into a readable format, chaosreader helps network administrators and security analysts identify potential threats, troubleshoot network issues, and understand the communication patterns within their network. With its flexibility and robust features, chaosreader is a valuable tool for anyone working with network traffic analysis on a Linux system.
## Chaosreader Syntax:
```bash
chaosreader [option] [filename]
```
## Options:
| Option           | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| -h               | Display help message                    |
| -o <outputfile>  | Specify output file for data extraction |
| -w               | Enable wordwrap                         |
| -t               | Add timestamps to output               |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description              |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| filename  | Specify the input file   |


:::caution
Use caution when running chaosreader as it may extract a large amount of data from the input file, potentially overwhelming the output file or system resources.
:::
## Chaosreader bash Examples:
### Extract Files from a Traffic Capture
```bash
chaosreader capture.pcap
```
This command will extract the files from the specified network traffic capture file "capture.pcap".

### Specify Output Directory
```bash
chaosreader capture.pcap -D output_directory
```
Using this command with the "-D" flag allows you to specify an output directory for the extracted files.

### View Information About the Extracted Files
```bash
chaosreader -I evil_traffic.extracted.evild
```
Running the chaosreader command with the "-I" flag will display information about the extracted files from the specified file "evil_traffic.extracted.evild".

### Extract Files and Create HTML Report
```bash
chaosreader capture.pcap -o output.html
```
This command will extract files from the specified network traffic capture file "capture.pcap" and create an HTML report named "output.html".

### Extract Files from a gzipped PCAP File
```bash
chaosreader -z capture.pcap.gz
```
Using the "-z" flag allows you to extract files from a gzipped PCAP file "capture.pcap.gz" using chaosreader.

### Ignore Non-HTTP Data while Extracting Files
```bash
chaosreader capture.pcap -x
```
By adding the "-x" flag to the chaosreader command, non-HTTP data will be ignored while extracting files from the specified network traffic capture file "capture.pcap".
:::tip
When using the chaosreader command in Linux, make sure to carefully read the documentation and understand the available options to extract and analyze network traffic data effectively.

### How do I use chaosreader in Linux?
To use the chaosreader command in Linux, execute the following command:
```bash
chaosreader -d extracted_traffic_directory captured_file
```

### How can I extract the traffic content from a pcap file using chaosreader in Linux?
To extract the traffic content from a pcap file using chaosreader in Linux, use the following command:
```bash
chaosreader -r captured_file
```

### How do I specify the output directory for extracted traffic when using chaosreader in Linux?
To specify the output directory for extracted traffic when using chaosreader in Linux, use the following command:
```bash
chaosreader -d output_directory captured_file
```

### Can chaosreader display the extracted data in a readable format in Linux?
Yes, chaosreader can display the extracted data in a human-readable format in Linux. You can do this using the command:
```bash
chaosreader -e extracted_text_file captured_file
```

### How can I analyze multiple pcap files using chaosreader in Linux?
To analyze multiple pcap files using chaosreader in Linux, you can use the following command:
```bash
for file in *.pcap; do chaosreader -r $file; done
```

### Is it possible to generate statistics from the extracted traffic data using chaosreader in Linux?
Yes, you can generate statistics from the extracted traffic data using chaosreader in Linux. Simply execute the following command:
```bash
chaosreader -s captured_file
```

### Can chaosreader decode encrypted traffic in Linux?
Chaosreader cannot decode encrypted traffic in Linux. It can only analyze and extract data from unencrypted packets captured in the pcap file.
