description: Learn how to use the Linux mkfifo command to create named pipes for inter-process communication. 
---

The `mkfifo` command in Linux is used to create named pipes, which are special types of files that allow inter-process communication. With `mkfifo`, you can establish communication channels between different processes for seamless data transfer. This command is particularly useful in shell scripting and when working with multiple programs that need to pass data to each other efficiently. Named pipes created with `mkfifo` can help streamline your workflow and improve the overall efficiency of your system.

## mkfifo Syntax:
```bash
mkfifo [option] [parameter]
```

## Linux mkfifo Options:
| Option | Description                     |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| -m     | Set the permission mode of the fifo |
| -Z     | Set the SELinux security context |

## mkfifo Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| path      | Specify the path for the fifo to be created       |

:::caution
Exercise caution when using the mkfifo command, as creating and managing fifo files requires proper understanding and consideration of inter-process communication mechanisms.

## How to use mkfifo command:
### Create a named pipe
```bash
mkfifo mypipe
```
Creates a named pipe called "mypipe".

### Check file type
```bash
file mypipe
```
Displays the file type of "mypipe" which should show "fifo".

### Read from a named pipe
```bash
cat mypipe
```
Reads data from the named pipe "mypipe".

### Write to a named pipe
```bash
echo "Hello, named pipe!" > mypipe
```
Writes the text "Hello, named pipe!" to the named pipe.

### Pipe data between commands
```bash
mkfifo pipe
```
Creates a named pipe called "pipe" for piping data between commands.

### Use named pipe for inter-process communication
```bash
mkfifo communication_pipe
```
Creates a named pipe "communication_pipe" for inter-process communication.

### Redirect output to a named pipe
```bash
ls -l > my_data_pipe
```
Redirects the output of the "ls -l" command to a named pipe called "my_data_pipe".

### Remove a named pipe
```bash
rm mypipe
```
Removes the named pipe "mypipe" from the filesystem.
:::tip
When using the mkfifo command, make sure to specify the correct options and values to create named pipes properly. Additionally, ensure that the permissions are set correctly to allow the appropriate read and write access.

### How do I use mkfifo in Linux?
To use the mkfifo command in Linux, execute the following command:
```bash
mkfifo /path/to/named_pipe
```

### How can I create multiple named pipes with mkfifo?
You can create multiple named pipes at once using the mkfifo command by providing the names of the pipes as arguments. For example:
```bash
mkfifo pipe1 pipe2 pipe3
```

### How can I check the permissions of a named pipe created with mkfifo?
You can use the ls command with the -l option to view the permissions of a named pipe created with mkfifo. For example:
```bash
ls -l /path/to/named_pipe
```

### Can mkfifo be used to create FIFOs with specific permissions?
Yes, you can specify the permissions for the named pipe created with mkfifo using the chmod command. For example:
```bash
mkfifo /path/to/named_pipe
chmod 777 /path/to/named_pipe
```

### How can I remove a named pipe created with mkfifo?
To remove a named pipe created with mkfifo, you can use the rm command. For example:
```bash
rm /path/to/named_pipe
```

### Can I use mkfifo to create named pipes in a specific directory?
Yes, you can specify the directory where you want to create the named pipe using the mkfifo command. For example:
```bash
mkfifo /path/to/directory/named_pipe
```

### How can I read from a named pipe created with mkfifo?
You can read from a named pipe created with mkfifo using standard file I/O operations in bash scripts or other programming languages. For example:
```bash
cat /path/to/named_pipe
```

### Is it possible to write data to a named pipe using mkfifo?
Yes, you can write data to a named pipe created with mkfifo using standard file I/O operations in bash scripts or other programming languages. For example:
```bash
echo "Data to write" > /path/to/named_pipe
```

### Can a named pipe created with mkfifo be used for inter-process communication?
Yes, named pipes created with mkfifo can be used for inter-process communication by enabling communication between multiple processes through reading and writing to the named pipe.

## Applications of the mkfifo command

- Creating named pipes for inter-process communication
- Setting up communication channels between processes
- Implementing communication mechanisms in shell scripts
- Providing a method for one-way communication between processes
