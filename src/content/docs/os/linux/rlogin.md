description: Learn how to use the rlogin command in Linux to remotely log in to a host without a password. 
---

The rlogin command in Linux allows users to remotely log in to a host without a password, provided that the same username exists on both the local and remote systems. It is a simple and convenient way to access a remote system and execute commands. The rlogin command establishes a connection to the specified host and prompts for a password if necessary. It is important to note that using rlogin may pose security risks, as it sends login information in plain text. It is recommended to use more secure alternatives such as SSH for remote logins.
