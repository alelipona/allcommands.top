The expand command in Linux is a useful tool for converting tabs in files to spaces. By default, it replaces tabs with spaces in the input files and writes the result to standard output. This command is handy for improving file readability and alignment, especially when sharing files with others or formatting code. It allows users to specify the tab stops, control the number of spaces each tab is replaced with, and choose the number of spaces between tab stops. With the expand command, users can easily customize the transformation of tabs to spaces based on their specific formatting requirements.

## expand Syntax:
```bash
expand [OPTION] [FILE]
```
