## How to use gawk command:

### Print Specific Fields from a File
```bash
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
```
Prints the first and third fields from the file "file.txt".

### Print if a Field Meets a Condition
```bash
awk '$3 > 50 {print $0}' data.csv
```
Prints the entire line from "data.csv" if the third field is greater than 50.

### Calculate Sum of a Column
```bash
awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' numbers.txt
```
Calculates the sum of the first column in "numbers.txt" and prints the total.

### Find and Replace Text in a File
```bash
gawk '{gsub(/old_word/, "new_word")} 1' textfile.txt
```
Replaces all occurrences of "old_word" with "new_word" in "textfile.txt".

### Print Lines Matching a Pattern
```bash
gawk '/keyword/' example.txt
```
Prints lines from "example.txt" containing the keyword "keyword".

### Filter Records Based on a Condition
```bash
gawk '$2 == "John" {print $0}' sales.csv
```
Prints records from "sales.csv" where the second field is equal to "John".

### Merge Two Files Based on a Key
```bash
gawk 'NR==FNR{a[$1]=$2;next} ($1 in a) {print $0, a[$1]}' file1.txt file2.txt
```
Merges two files "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" based on a common key in the first column.

### Custom Field Separator
```bash
gawk -F: '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd
```
Uses ":" as the field separator to print the first and third fields from "/etc/passwd".
