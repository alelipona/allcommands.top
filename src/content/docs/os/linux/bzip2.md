```
Compresses the file "file.txt" using the bzip2 compression algorithm.

### Compress Multiple Files into a Single Archive
```bash
bzip2 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
Compresses multiple files ("file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt") into a single bzip2 archive.

### Decompress a bzip2 Compressed File
```bash
bzip2 -d file.txt.bz2
```
Decompresses the bzip2 compressed file "file.txt.bz2" back to its original form.

### View Compression Statistics
```bash
bzip2 -v file.txt
```
Compresses the file "file.txt" using bzip2 and displays compression statistics during the process.
:::tip
When using the bzip2 command in Linux, make sure to familiarize yourself with the various options and parameters available to effectively compress or decompress files. Additionally, always remember to verify the success of your compression or decompression operations by checking the output or the resulting file.
