## How to use whoami command:
### Print the current username
```bash
whoami
```
This command will display the current username of the user running the command.

### Assign the result of whoami to a variable
```bash
current_user=$(whoami)
echo "The current user is: $current_user"
```
In this example, the result of the whoami command is stored in a variable and then displayed using echo.

### Execute a command as the current user
```bash
sudo -u $(whoami) <command>
```
This syntax allows you to run a command as the current user using sudo.

### Print the current username and host
```bash
echo "Current user: $(whoami)@$(hostname)"
```
This command will display the current username and hostname.

### Show the user ID of the current user
```bash
id -u $(whoami)
```
The above command will display the user ID of the current user by using the whoami result in conjunction with the id command.

### Validate the current user's permissions
```bash
stat $(whoami)
```
The stat command can be used to check the permissions of the current user by passing the result of whoami.

### Display the group membership of the current user
```bash
groups $(whoami)
```
This command will show the group memberships of the current user by invoking whoami to get the username.

### Check if the current user is a member of a specific group
```bash
if groups $(whoami) | grep -q <group_name>; then echo "User is a member of <group_name>"; else echo "User is not a member of <group_name>"; fi
```
The command above verifies whether the current user is a member of a specified group by using whoami output and grep.
:::tip
When using the whoami command in Linux, remember that it simply prints the effective username of the current user. This can be helpful in scripts or commands where you need to know the current user executing them.
