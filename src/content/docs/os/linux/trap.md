---

The trap command in Linux allows users to set and execute commands upon receiving signals. This feature enhances script functionality and error handling, making it a valuable tool for system administrators and developers. By using the trap command, you can define specific actions to take when signals are received, such as cleaning up temporary files or logging information before exiting a script. Additionally, the trap command provides a way to handle errors gracefully and improve the overall reliability of your scripts.

## trap Syntax:
```bash
trap [action] [signals]
```
## Options:
| Option    | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| -          | Not applicable                    |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| action    | The action to be taken when the specified signals are received |
| signals   | One or more signals to trap and execute the specified action for |

:::caution
Exercise caution when using the trap command as it can affect the behavior of signals within a script or command. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected results or errors.

## trap Command Samples:
### Trap a Signal and Execute a Command
```bash
trap "echo 'Signal received'" SIGINT
```
This command traps the SIGINT signal (usually generated by pressing Ctrl+C) and executes the specified command when the signal is received.

### Execute Cleanup Commands when Exiting
```bash
trap "rm -f /tmp/tempfile" EXIT
```
A trap command that ensures a temporary file is removed when the script or shell session exits.

### Ignore a Specific Signal
```bash
trap "" SIGHUP
```
Using an empty string as the action in the trap command ignores the SIGHUP signal.

### Trap and Handle Errors Gracefully
```bash
trap "echo 'Error occurred'; exit 1" ERR
```
Setting up a trap to notify about errors and exit the script with an error status if an error occurs.

### Execute a Command on Termination
```bash
trap "echo 'Terminating...'; cleanup_function" TERM
```
The script will execute the cleanup_function and display a termination message when receiving the TERM signal (for example, when running the "kill" command).

### Trap a Combination of Signals
```bash
trap "echo 'Received SIGINT or SIGTERM'" SIGINT SIGTERM
```
This command traps both the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals and executes the specified action when either signal is received.

### Reset a Trap
```bash
trap - SIGINT
```
Removing the trap on the SIGINT signal, which will revert the default behavior of the shell for that signal.
:::tip
When using the trap command in Linux, make sure to set up the traps properly to handle signals and execute specific actions accordingly.
