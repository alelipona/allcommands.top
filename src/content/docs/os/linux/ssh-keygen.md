title: Linux ssh-keygen command
description: Generate secure SSH keys with the Linux ssh-keygen command for secure authentication.
---

The Linux ssh-keygen command is used to generate, manage, and convert authentication keys for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It creates a public and private key pair that can be used for secure communication between systems. These keys are crucial for authenticating users and establishing secure connections over a network. The ssh-keygen command offers various options for generating different types of keys, changing key passphrases, and converting keys to other formats. By using this command, users can enhance the security of their SSH connections and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

## ssh-keygen Syntax:
```bash
ssh-keygen [options] [parameters]
```

## Options:
| Option | Description                                     |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| -t     | Specifies the type of key to create             |
| -b     | Specifies the number of bits in the key         |
| -C     | Provides a new comment                          |
| -f     | Specifies the filename of the key file          |
| -N     | Sets the passphrase for the key                 |
| -q     | Quiet mode, doesn't display any warning messages|
| -y     | Outputs the public key based on the private key |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                                                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| keyfile   | Optional parameter to specify the location of the key file   |
| email     | Email address to associate with the SSH key (for -C option) |
| passphrase| Passphrase to protect the private key (for -N option)        |
| publickey | File to output the public key (for -y option)                |

:::caution
Exercise caution when using the ssh-keygen command, as creating and managing SSH keys is a critical security practice. Be sure to securely store your private key and avoid sharing it with unauthorized users.

## ssh-keygen Usage:
### Generate a New SSH Key Pair
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
This command generates a new SSH key pair.

### Generate a New SSH Key Pair with a Specific Key Type and Size
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
Generates a new SSH key pair with RSA as the key type and a key length of 4096 bits.

### Save the SSH Private Key to a Specific File
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_custom
```
Generates a new SSH key pair with RSA as the key type, a key length of 2048 bits and saves the private key to the file "id_rsa_custom" in the ".ssh" directory.

### Generate a New SSH Key Pair with a Specific Comment
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 1024 -C "my_key"
```
Generates a new SSH key pair with RSA as the key type, a key length of 1024 bits, and a comment "my_key".
:::tip
When using the ssh-keygen command in Linux, make sure to carefully manage and secure your generated keys. Keep your private key safe and do not share it with anyone. It is also recommended to set a passphrase to protect your private key from unauthorized use.
