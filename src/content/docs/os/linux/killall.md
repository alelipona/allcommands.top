description: Learn how to use the killall command in Linux to terminate processes by name efficiently.
---

The Linux killall command is used to terminate processes by name, allowing for the quick and efficient termination of multiple processes at once. This command can be helpful in situations where specific processes need to be stopped without knowing their exact PIDs. By specifying the name of the process to be terminated, killall can help streamline the process management on a Linux system.

## killall Syntax:
```bash
killall [options] [process name]
```
## Options:
| Option | Description                               |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| -e     | Show the argument list of the processes killed. |
| -g     | Only match processes in the process group. |
| -i     | Ignore case distinctions in process names. |
| -q     | Be quiet; only report errors. |
| -s     | Send a specified signal. |
| -v     | Report if the signal is successfully sent. |

## Parameters:
| Parameter    | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| process name | Specify the name of the process to kill. |

:::caution
Exercise caution while using the `killall` command, as it sends signals to processes and terminates them abruptly. Make sure to double-check the process name before running the command to avoid unintended consequences.

```bash
killall firefox
```

```
The -9 option sends a SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate all instances of the Chrome browser.

### Kill all instances of a specific user's processes
```bash
killall -u username
```
This command will terminate all processes belonging to the user "username".

### Kill all instances of a process by process ID
```bash
killall -p 1234
```
This command will terminate the process with the ID 1234.

### Kill all instances of a process group
```bash
killall -g groupname
```
Terminates all processes that belong to the process group named "groupname".

### Quietly kill all instances of a process by name
```bash
killall -q processname
```
This command will suppress the error messages that may occur while terminating all instances of the specified process.

### Kill all instances of a process except for a specified one
```bash
killall -e processname
```
This command will terminate all instances of the specified process except for the one that initiated the killall command.
