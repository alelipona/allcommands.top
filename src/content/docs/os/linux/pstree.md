title: pstree Linux Command Guide
description: Learn how to use the Linux pstree command to display a process tree in a structured format. Easily visualize the hierarchy of processes running on your system.
---

The pstree command in Linux allows users to view a structured tree diagram of all running processes on the system. By displaying parent-child relationships, pstree provides a clear overview of the process hierarchy, making it easier to understand how different processes are related and organized. This can be particularly useful for troubleshooting, monitoring system performance, and managing processes effectively.
## pstree Syntax:
```bash
pstree [option] [pid]
```
## Options:
| Option | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| -a     | Show command line arguments      |
| -c     | Show the command name            |
| -h     | Highlight the current process    |
| -l     | Use long format                  |
| -n     | Sort by PID                      |
| -p     | Show PIDs                        |
| -u     | Display UID                      |
| -v     | Display PPID                      |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| pid       | Specify the process ID to start | 

:::caution
Exercise caution when using the `pstree` command, as it displays a tree of processes and their PIDs in the system. Incorrect use of the command may lead to misinterpretation of process relationships and potentially unwanted actions in the system.

## pstree Command Samples:
### Display the process tree
```bash
pstree
```
This command displays the current process tree in a hierarchical format.

### Display the process tree with a specific PID
```bash
pstree -p 1234
```
This command displays the process tree starting from the process with PID 1234.

### Display the process tree with additional information
```bash
pstree -a
```
This command displays the process tree with additional information such as the process's full command line.

### Display the process tree recursively
```bash
pstree -h
```
This command displays the process tree in a format suitable for viewing on the terminal.

### Display the process tree with ASCII characters
```bash
pstree -A
```
This command displays the process tree using ASCII characters for better readability.

### Display the process tree along with CPU usage
```bash
pstree -c
```
This command shows the process tree along with CPU usage information.

### Display the process tree with user/group details
```bash
pstree -ug
```
This command displays the process tree along with user and group details for each process.
:::tip

### What is the purpose of the pstree command?
The pstree command displays running processes as a tree. It shows the relationship between processes, with the parent-child hierarchy represented visually.

### How can I display the process tree of a specific process ID with pstree?
You can display the process tree for a specific process ID by using the following command:
```bash
pstree -p <PID>
```

### Can I display the pstree with full path names of processes?
Yes, you can display the pstree with full path names of processes by using the following command:
```bash
pstree -a
```

### How can I show the pstree with the user that owns each process?
To show the pstree with the user that owns each process, you can use the following command:
```bash
pstree -u
```

### Is there a way to display the pstree with the command line arguments of processes?
You can display the pstree with the command line arguments of processes by using the following command:
