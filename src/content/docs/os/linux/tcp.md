---

The Linux tcp command is a powerful tool for controlling TCP traffic and troubleshooting network-related issues. With the tcp command, you can view and manipulate the TCP network connections on your system, as well as monitor the TCP protocol status. This command provides detailed information about TCP connections, including their state, local and remote addresses, ports, and more. By utilizing the tcp command, you can analyze network traffic, diagnose connectivity problems, and optimize network performance. It is a valuable utility for network administrators and system operators who need to manage TCP connections effectively.

## tcp Syntax:
```bash
tcp [options] [parameters]
```
## Options:
| Option | Description                     |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| -l     | List all active TCP connections |
| -t     | Display TCP connection table     |
| -s     | Display TCP statistics           |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| port      | Specify the TCP port number        |
| address   | Specify the IP address              |
| interval  | Specify the time interval for stats |

:::caution
Exercise caution when using the tcp command as it provides detailed information about TCP connections and network statistics. Misuse of this command can potentially expose sensitive data and may affect network performance.
:::
## tcp Usage:
### List all TCP connections
```bash
tcp
```
Lists all TCP connections currently established.

### Filter TCP connections by process id
```bash
tcp -p <process_id>
```
Filters TCP connections based on a specific process ID.

### Display TCP connections using numeric output
```bash
tcp -n
```
Displays TCP connections using numerical output instead of resolving hostnames.

### Monitor TCP traffic in real-time
```bash
tcp -t
```
Monitors TCP traffic in real-time to analyze network activities.
:::tip
When using the tcp command in Linux, make sure to carefully read the command options and parameters to avoid any unintended consequences. It is also recommended to refer to the official documentation or man pages for detailed information on the tcp command.
