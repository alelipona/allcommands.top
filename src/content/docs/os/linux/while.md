---

The Linux while command is a powerful tool used to create loops and automate repetitive tasks in the command line interface. It allows users to continuously execute a set of commands as long as a specified condition is met. By using the while command, users can streamline processes, iterate through lists of data, and perform complex tasks with ease. Mastering the while command is essential for any Linux user looking to boost productivity and efficiency in their workflow.

## while Syntax:
```bash
while [condition]; do
    # commands to execute
done
```
## Options:
| Option | Description  |
|--------|--------------|
| -n     | Check for a non-empty string |
| -z     | Check for an empty string     |
| -r     | Check for a non-empty file     |
| -s     | Check for a non-empty file or string |

## Parameters:
| Parameter | Description            |
|-----------|------------------------|
| condition | The condition to check |

:::caution
Exercise caution while using the while command as it can cause an infinite loop if the condition is not properly defined or updated within the loop.

## while Command Samples:
### Print Numbers from 1 to 5
```bash
n=1
while [ $n -le 5 ]
do
  echo $n
  n=$((n+1))
done
```
This script prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

### Check Disk Space Usage
```bash
while true
do
  df -h
  sleep 5
done
```
This script checks the disk space usage every 5 seconds using a while loop.

### Read Lines from a File
```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "$line"
done < file.txt
```
This script reads and prints each line from a file using a while loop.

### Copy Files in a Directory
```bash
files=$(ls /path/to/source/directory)
destination="/path/to/destination/directory"

while IFS= read -r file
do
  cp "$file" "$destination"
done <<< "$files"
```
This script copies all files in a directory to another directory using a while loop.

### Count Down Timer
```bash
n=10
while [ $n -ge 0 ]
do
  echo "$n seconds remaining"
  sleep 1
  n=$((n-1))
done
```
This script creates a countdown timer from 10 to 0 using a while loop.

### Monitor Process
```bash
while pgrep -x "process_name" > /dev/null
do
  echo "The process is running..."
  sleep 10
done
echo "The process has stopped."
```
This script monitors a specific process and displays a message if it is still running using a while loop.

### User Input Validation
```bash
valid=false
while [ $valid == false ]
do
  read -p "Enter a number (1-10): " num
  if [[ $num -ge 1 && $num -le 10 ]]
  then
    valid=true
    echo "Valid input: $num"
  else
    echo "Invalid input. Please try again."
  fi
done
```
This script validates user input to ensure it is within a specified range using a while loop.
### How do I use while in Linux?
To use the while command in Linux, execute the following command:
```bash
while true; do echo "Hello, World!"; done
```

### What is the syntax for while loops in Linux?
The syntax for while loops in Linux is as follows:
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    # Commands to be executed
done
```

### Can I use a variable in a while loop in Linux?
Yes, you can use a variable in a while loop in Linux. Here is an example:
```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
    echo $counter
    ((counter++))
done
```

### How can I exit a while loop in Linux?
You can exit a while loop in Linux by using the `break` statement. Here's an example:
```bash
while true; do
    read -p "Enter a number (0 to exit): " num
    if [ $num -eq 0 ]; then
        break
    fi
done
```

### How do I skip to the next iteration in a while loop in Linux?
To skip to the next iteration in a while loop in Linux, you can use the `continue` statement. Here's an example:
```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
    ((counter++))
    if [ $counter -eq 3 ]; then
        continue
    fi
    echo $counter
done
```

### Can I use multiple conditions in a while loop in Linux?
Yes, you can use multiple conditions in a while loop in Linux by combining them with logical operators. Here's an example:
```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 10 ] && [ $counter -ne 5 ]; do
    echo $counter
    ((counter++))
done
```

:::tip
The while command in Linux is a powerful tool for creating loops that can run until certain conditions are met. Make sure to properly define your condition within the while loop to avoid infinite loops. Testing your while loops with simple conditions first can help ensure they behave as expected.

## Applications of the while command

1. Reading input from a file line by line and processing it in a loop.
2. Iterating through a range of numbers or a list of items and performing a specific action for each iteration.
3. Monitoring a process or service continuously until a certain condition is met.
4. Creating an infinite loop for tasks that need to run continuously until manually stopped.
5. Implementing a countdown timer or progress indicator for a script or program.
6. Parsing and processing data from an external command in a loop.
7. Handling dynamic or changing conditions within a script by continuously checking and responding to those conditions.
