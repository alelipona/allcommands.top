The Linux join command is used to merge lines from two sorted files based on a common field. By default, it uses the first field of each line as the join key. This command is useful for combining data from different sources, such as databases or spreadsheets. Joining files can help you analyze and manipulate data more efficiently.

| Option | Description                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| -t     | Specify the field separator character   |
| -1     | Join on the specified field from file1  |
| -2     | Join on the specified field from file2  |
| -i     | Ignore case while comparing fields      |
| -v     | Apply only to non-matching lines        |
| -a     | Print all lines                         |
